# AndroidToDoApp
This is a simple ToDo application. The application enables users to add, delete and edit an item from a ToDo list.
- To add an item, the user types the item text in a text field and click on the button "ADD"
- To delete an item, the user clicks and hold on the item (long click)
- To edit an item, the user clicks on the item, the application redirects to a new screen where the user can edit the text and click on "Edit Item"

The application persists the ToDo items in a file called todo.txt in the application's data directory.
